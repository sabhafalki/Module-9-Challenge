# Module-9-Challenge  Surfs_up
Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval with Jupyter Notebook, SQLite and SQLAlchemy

# Overview of Project #
The purpose of this Project is to analyze the weather trends in **Oahu,Hawaii**. In order, to open a Surf and Shake shop that severes surf boards and ice cream to tourist and if the shop on Oahu does well, they could expand to other islands. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature trends data has been requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

The analysis consisted of the following:
1. The Summary Statistics for June
2. The Summary Statistics for December

# Resources #

- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Programming Files: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, climate_analysis.ipynb
-	Data Tools: Python SQL toolkit (SQLAlchemy), Object Relational Mapper, pandas, numpy
- Software: SQLlite, Python 3.9.2, Flask, Jupyter Notebook

# Results #
## The Summary Statistics for June ##
The data gives summary statistics for the temperature trends in June form the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database.<br>
The following depicts the June temps DataFrame:<br>
![June](/surfs_up/Image/June_temp.png) <br>

The average temperature recorded in June is about 75 degrees F and it is approximately 23 degrees c. It is clear with this analysis that June is one of the favourable month for the sustainability business of surfing and ice cream in the year.<br>

## The Summary Statistics for December ##
The data gives summary statistics for the temperature trends in December form the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database.<br>
The following depicts the December temps DataFrame:<br>
![dec_temps](/surfs_up/Image/dec_temps.png) <br>

The average temperature recorded in December is about 71 degrees F and it is approximately 21 degrees c. By this analysis,It is clear with that December is also favourable month for the sustainability business of surfing and ice cream in the year. We can analyze that Oahu is a great location for the new surf shop.<br>

### Analysis  ###
The Analysis for both months June and December are as follows:<br>
![june_dec_temps](/surfs_up/Image/june_dec_temps.png) <br>
- The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.o	This represents a -5% change in average temperature from June to December.
